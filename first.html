<!-- css is used to give style and appearance to the htmml elements 
    there are three types of css styling
    1. inline css
        when we combine css in html tags
        the value of attribute written in double quotes is inline css
        eg: <h1 style="color:red;">hello</h1>

    2. internal css
        when we write css as tag of html file in the same file
        eg: <style>
                h1{
                    color:red;
                }
            </style>

    3. external css
        when we write a complete different file for css
        you will first make a file with .css extension
        and then we have to call by this method
        <link rel"stylesheet" href="file_name.css"> and it is be used in head tag only-->
